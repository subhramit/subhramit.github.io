    content: `Whenever we think about fantasies like the Harry Potter series, one of the first things that come to our minds is a world of “magic” - a world we can only fantasize about in our imagination, one which is far, far away from reality.
    
            Interestingly, I have stumbled upon a few concepts that I could very practically relate to from the series, in my life. One could say there were mostly realizations rather than direct lessons, as I realized there were things that I had already been doing or situations that I had already been facing since as long as I can remember, that were portrayed in a different, “magical” way in the series.
            
            One of the best examples among these are the “Dementors”. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and onwards, we are introduced to the Dementors, which are extremely dreadful creatures that kill you very painfully, by sucking out every bit of happiness you have within yourself. This doesn't sound like an alien concept, does it? In our day to day lives, we come across our own Dementors - which could be people, objects or places that suck out our happiness and leave us feeling empty and lacking the will to move forward.
            
            The only way of defense against these creatures is also introduced in the same installment, that is, the “Patronus charm”. Once the charm is deployed, it creates a shield of happiness onto which the Dementors try feeding on, and ultimately get scared being overpowered by positive feelings and escape away.
            
            There is, however, one catch associated with this charm - unlike other spells, a wizard cannot trigger it just by waving his wand or by chanting the spell, or even both together. What is essential for the manifestation of a Patronus is that while casting the spell, the wizard has to think about his most powerful, positive memory and channel it into the spell, and that creates the defense against the foulest of creatures in the dark wizarding world.
            
            Just like we could relate to the Dementors in our real life, I came to realize that the Patronus charm exists in our world as well. Life never goes along a straight line, we all have our share of ups and downs. Whenever we feel our spirit of life is being threatened, something we can do is that we just close our eyes, and remember all the powerful memories that we have. Maybe it's about a place. Maybe it's with our parents. Maybe it's with a person who's your best friend, or once was, now turned a stranger, or maybe even an enemy - the only thing is that the memory should be powerful. It stands as a reminder to us that if life has been good once upon a time, it can be better again. And that's how the Dementors wither away, making you remember that life is worth it, after all.`,

    title: 'Thought - The Lemur',
    date: '24.06.2025',
    content: `Yesterday, I was watching Flow (as I might have mentioned before, I am a sucker for Disney-style animated films), and in it there was a Lemur who was obsessed with collecting useless items (glass bottles, mirrors and trinkets, to be precise), even at the face of a flood, which he needs to survive to even be able to entertain himself with these. It was as if they are so important, and indispensable. "What a foolish animal", I thought to myself. And then, after a while, it hit me - the Lemur "thinks" these objects are important. How different are most human beings from the Lemur, just the scope and scale of this obsession being different?`,

    title: '"Porichito haather ador e"',
    date: '19.09.2025',
    content: `There is a song from the Bengali movie "Autograph" called "Beche Thakar Gaan" (the song of survival). It has a line in particular that has been on my mind since the past couple of days.
              The line is "Porichito haather ador e", which means, "in the affection and comfort of familiar hands".
              Isn't that what we all deeply wish for - to have familiar hands we can rest our heads on?
              
              Hey, if you're ever reading this - please know that it was not easy. I miss you. Life is unfortunate, humans are delicate, and nobody deserves to go through the kind of suffering you have been through.
              I know I was far from perfect, but I always wished that I could make it a bit better for you, to the capacity of however-much I could. I hope I was able to, if even a little bit, for as long as I was there. Nobody can take away the fact you are one of the bravest, strongest and most honest human beings I have ever met. You were worth it.
              We didn't deserve this - only to end up where we are now.
              I wish it was us who could make it, but maybe not all things are meant to be. And that's alright.
              As unbelievable as it may sound (or maybe believable to you as you got to know me at least a little bit over the past two years) - I really want you to be happy. I want you to be cared for.
              I hope someone comes in your life to give you the affection of "porichito haath", so that you never have to feel what it is like for someone to go away from your life, ever again. I want them to tuck you tight and never let go.
              It sucks that the hands couldn't be mine, but I shall pray that it is someone better. For both you and me.
              Be happy, and do keep me in your memory.
              
              For the love of cats.`,

    title: 'Tired',
    date: '20.09.2025',
    content: `tl;dr: Humans are stupid.
    
    The number of humans that are stupid is really astonishing. It is astonishing how we all evolved together as a species, so differently to have a cerebral capacity that's unmatched across all living creatures (at least on earth, that we know of), and still happen to be so painfully stupid.
    And by "stupid", I don't mean stupid in an intentionally malicious or malevolent way, although some may argue that that may be the case in some (or even many) scenarios (we'll get to that later). Nor do I mean "stupid" in the sense of not knowing that Pluto is a dwarf planet, or how to derive the Navier-Stokes equation from the fundamental laws of physics, or how many years ago dinosaurs became extinct (honestly, I don't even care about that kind of smartness beyond a certain point of appreciation that they dedicated some time of their life to learn all that). 
    For the sake of this present discussion, what I mean by "stupid" is just that they are unaware, and lazy.
    Unaware in the sense that they don't understand that everyone's life is different. And even if you give two humans the exact same life, their thinking and perception of everything can (and does) manifest and evolve differently, and in many cases, very differently. That's just how we are. 
    I also say "lazy", because they don't even make an effort to understand that. This is "painful", because as Ricky Gervais said, being stupid is like being dead - you are unaware of it, but it is painful to others who are associated with you.
    
    I am tired of people being casually stupid to not understand that they are making another person feel miserable for no reason at all. Suffering that is not required. Suffering that can be prevented.
    
    Now, I am about to argue that none of this is ever intentional. 
    Deep breath, because this is something that takes a bit of resistance to firstly take in, and even more to act out.
    Think of a time when someone really wronged you. Made you feel miserable even when they were perfectly awake, sober and aware of what they were doing. They "chose" to do it to you even though they knew perfectly well that it would hurt you. Heck, it may be that that's what they wanted to achieve. Or lets say even if they didn't begin with that intention, think of a time when they continued to do the same thing even after you told them it's hurting you.
    Now, stop. Pause for a moment, and think about what I am about to say very carefully - 
    If they really understood what they were doing, would they have done it?
    No, think about it again - if they really understood what their actions are causing, would they still choose to do it?
    If you've thought deeply enough, you would arrive at the truth that true understanding of one's own actions brings with it the awareness of what it causes another to go through.
    It also brings with itself compassion and empathy towards another. All of this, at the end, is a by-product of self-awareness (or the "knowledge of self"), because once you know what hurts you, you know what hurts someone else. You are then able to put themselves in someone else's shoes and think of them like another human being just like yourself.
    You can relate this with the imagination of a child causing chaos all around. If the child understood what they were doing, they would not act in such a stupid way. But we don't really use the word "stupid" for them, do we? We just give them a hug, and most of the times, they calm down.
    My claim is that most people never grow up.
    
    Now, this is not to take away the concept of morality that I believe so strongly in or claim that the way to stop someone from hurting you is to go and hug them - grown-up people are objectively assholes or good people depending on their actions. I am just arguing that who they are among the two is only a result of difference in self-awareness, provided they have the freedom and power to affect someone.
    Nor do I think that people should be excused for all the horrible things they do, just because we develop this understanding (if we are able to). This just gives a framework to understand other people better, and maybe help forgive some of their actions and save us the turmoil of having to drag the cause of a negative incident with us apart from the incident itself which we already have the backlog of recovering from.
    
    But yeah, back to the primary topic, I am tired of people being this stupid. I am tired of having to explain myself to people who are not ready to understand even though they try to dig inside my head just because I welcome curiosity. When someone has a sensitive aspect of life to talk about, especially when you are the one who wants to hear it, listening just to challenge them does no good (in fact, it harms). Listening to understand makes a world of difference. And I really mean - a world of difference.
    The world lacks empathy. Severely.
    
    You know the funny part which is so easy to forget? You and I are members of the same stupid human species, and thus are subject to these very same flaws. The least we can do is ask for forgiveness once the realization of stupidity and having hurt someone as a consequence hits (whether they tell you about it or not), and maybe forgive people for similar kind of stupidity when on the receiving end.`,

    title: '"Part of life"',
    date: '20.09.2025',
    content: `You may (or may not), at some point, wonder about the time gap between the first two posts I have in this section.
    Well, I don't know. Actually, I think I do. I wrote the first post when (or around the time) I was making this blog website, and it was a time when it was summer vacation (we used to get long ones as summers would get really brutal back in Pilani, the place where my university was situated) and I was also taking a sort of a "vacation from life" due to the chain of events that had unfolded the preceding semester. It was one of the darkest phases of my life, so I decided that I'll spend that summer break doing only the things I love, and not worry about anything else.
    After that, I had a lot of (necessary) things to worry about again, and I wish I had not done myself the disservice to stall writing for "when I feel more settled". That never happens. Life never really lets you settle.
    
    I am currently trying to explore things that give me true joy once again. This time, regardless of whatever is there to worry about. I would be lying if I said it was a natural impulse. Situations in life proved to me again that I can very well spend forever trying to wait for the time when I'd have no issues to take care of, and have nothing to worry about.
    
    I remember when a lot of the full-time employees at the company where I was interning during my final year were laid off out of the blue due to restructuring, I ran to meet and have a final chat with one of the first mentors I was assigned there when he was leaving the office. He had always been very patient and had taught me a lot.
    When I started talking about how unexpected all of this was, he just smiled (not out of happiness, but it was not a fake one either - it was just a different kind of smile), and said, "Part of life." before leaving.
    
    That moment really hit me. And I remember it to this day.
    Because after all, that's what everything is.
    "Part of life."`,

    I feel like being engulfed by them. I feel like being one with them.
    They are so chaotic, yet so calming at the same time. They would only be second to watching the night sky when it comes to my favourite experiences. But maybe someday I would be able to lie on a beach beside the waves, while observing the night sky?
    Or maybe while lying down on a boat in the middle of an ocean at night?
    Maybe I'll even get a chance to close my eyes, and eventually fall asleep?
    I think I just expanded my bucket list.`,

    title: '"One more love song"',
    date: '29.09.2025',
    content: `So, love songs are not particularly my genre. Sure, I enjoyed Taylor Swift's "Love Story" when I came across it, but the category was never one I would consciously look for.
    That being said, I really appreciate well-written love songs from time to time. I sat down listing how my favourite "love" song changed through the years.
    I really spent some time coming back to Roja (Version 2, by Hariharan), and here's my conclusion - I don't think there is a "greater" love song ever written by humans, or there will ever be.
    The only song in my mind that comes close is "There Will Be Time" by Mumford & Sons, Baaba Maal.
    
    I have a lot to talk about the topic (love) in general, but battling laziness is a real thing. I also just recovered from recurring typhoid fever over the last 6 days.
    
    I was thinking whether to have a separate "Rants" page to write about all the things I find to be wrong about the world, and another counterpart for the "Things I'm grateful for". Still contemplating on that.`,

    title: 'Borrowed peace',
    date: '21.10.2025',
    content: `Finally back home, under the excuse of the Diwali break (I honestly couldn't care less, but it was the only way left I could get a long enough break as I (purposely) didn't take one during Dusshera to preserve my mental well-being, at which, I still failed miserably).
    I also quit social media (particularly Instagram) before coming here, and the net increase in mental stillness I am experiencing as a consequence is making me re-think if I ever want to go back again. I might keep things this way. I don't find any utility for it anymore anyway. Scrolling reels and talking to more people is fun, but it messes with your dopamine baseline, and by the end, you don't really feel fulfilled and keep wanting more.
    Before deciding to quit, I tried to configure the space a bit better for myself by removing more than a hundred people from my followers/following. During the process, I kept asking myself questions like "Why did I keep these people around in my social space, if whenever I see them or hear their names, I feel something negative?", "Why did I put up with all this for so long?" and "Why do I follow this person? Heck, why does this person even follow me? We don't even know each other."
    September was quite a month for housekeeping, you can say. I cut off from a bunch of people in real life as well, interacting with whom stopped feeling right lately. I am really glad and give myself gratitude for taking these efforts.
    I wish I had a thicker skin, I really do. But I don't. So that's that.
    
    I also think much more than the average person. How do I know that? Because more often than not, I am told "Itna mat socha kar" and "Eto bhabish na" ("Don't think so much"). But I love thinking, sometimes even at the cost of being less mindful. Sometimes, it may be too much, but more often than not, I find that I have a problem with people instead for not putting much thought into things (even the bare minimum). But that just may be me.
    
    I am really fine by myself if you leave me be. I am not a full-fledged introvert, but extroverts do think that I lack enjoyment in my life if I spend the weekend with myself instead of "going out somewhere". Don't get me wrong - I absolutely enjoy having weekend plans and going out with my friends, but if the plan gets cancelled for some reason, I do feel sad about it, but I also feel equally happy that I now have more me-time, as if it's an equally enjoyable opportunity.
    In fact, when I think of it, the most enjoyable and nostalgic moments I have in my life mainly consist of time I spent with myself, doing something. And mostly with music on.
    That's also when I figured out that what people call "loneliness" is not a problem that arises due to lack of people around to do things with. It's something much deeper, and springs from within.
    
    Back to the present, I have been really lucky this time - I was able to meet a very old and dear friend of mine after many, many years. He was my best friend in school till 10th (after which he moved to Kolkata, a different city, whereas I stayed in my town), and still happens to be the first person I call when things, lets just say, take a "really" unexpected turn in life.
    
    I'm thinking what would be the best possible way to spend the remaining four days here, as I have my flight back to Bangalore this Sunday.
    And life goes on. Sometimes too fast.
