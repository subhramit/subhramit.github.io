        <div class="text-xl text-start font-serif pl-62 ">- John Keating, Dead Poets Society (1989)</div>
        <div class="text-xl text-start font-serif font-medium pl-62 pt-4 pr-62">
          <p>When it comes to poetry, I have never believed in constrained definitions about words on a page. I have always felt poets are not just the ones who write poetry, but also the ones who just possess a poetic mind - a mind that is capable of appreciating poetry or anything that is poetic. And here births the paradox - as all poetry is created by the poets, so that means all that is considered poetic is also only made so by the poets themselves. <br>
            <br>
            I always imagined an ideal "poets society" to be one in which people can, without any obligation to do so, come and sit together during a random sunset, look at the sky and just drown in the moment. Perhaps this is why I never made it to my college's poetry club.
            <br>
            I don't write poems often, nor do I know if I'll ever write again, but here are some words that I put together during different occassions and needless to say, in different states of mind.

        <div class="text-xl text-start font-serif font-medium pl-62 pt-2 italic">
          <p>A mad world it is, perhaps <br>
            Where life is an unsolicited gift. <br>
            Before drowning in the nectar of the clouds, <br>
            In the wide open sky, we look for a rift. <br>
            <br>
            I don't know if it counts into sanity <br>
            When roses fascinate us even after countless heartbreaks. <br>
            To tell apart love from madness <br>
            Is to escape a dream from which one never wakes. <br>
            <br>
            The wonders of what's beyond death <br>
            Are thoughts by which many are fazed. <br>
            As time ensnares us in this journey of life, love and death, <br>
            I think it is madness to not be amazed.</p>

          <p>Oh, haven't you wondered <br>
            Why, by the storms you're always adored? <br>
            Why, when the dark, moonless sky prevails, <br>
            You're the only one still ashore? <br>
            <br>
            So fierce and so unforgiving, or so the tales say - <br>
            “Dare anything stand in their way!” <br>
            But you think it's a mystery why, when they soar <br>
            You feel you’re somewhere a part of the lore. <br>
            <br>
            So look me in the eye and tell me, <br>
            Have you truly never wondered why, <br>
            When you look in the mirror <br>
            You find something you truly adore?</p>
