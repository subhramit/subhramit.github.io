          <p>Hi, I'm Subhramit. I hail from Alipurduar, West Bengal. I'm currently an undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, India, majoring in Computer Science and Biological Sciences. In simpler words, I study living and non-living systems, and might continue to do so for a living. I am also currently heading one of the Robotics teams of my university. Before anything else, I am a huge fan of Richard P. Feynman and Robin Williams.</p>

        <div class="text-xl text-start font-serif font-medium pl-72 pt-4 pr-72">
          <p>My hobbies include journalling, watching stand-up comedy, reading poetry and philosophical quotes, watching sunsets and staring at the night sky. I love Disney movies. Whenever I'm able to carve out time, I am also an avid reader of Psychology and Cognitive Sciences. Back in my pre-engineering days, I used to nerd about Organic Chemistry.</p>

          <p>During his days at art school, Kenny Sebastian realized that there are two kinds of artists in the world - the ones who paint for themselves and the ones who paint for others to experience it. I believe that all of life is art, and I have kept (and will keep) a good part of my life painting for myself. I was in search of a creative outlet so that I could live the life of the other artist, and hence I made this blog page. Apart from that, it also carried a good excuse for me to learn website development, so here we are.</p>
